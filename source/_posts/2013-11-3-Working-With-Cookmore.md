[Cookmore](http://www.cookmore.com)

During my time at Aisle Rocket Studios I have had the immense pleasure of working on the site Cookmore.com. Cookmore is a community based cooking site. Regular people, as well as professional chefs can post recipes on the site.

Much like the inspiration blog, Cookmore is built on a completely custom Wordpress install. Unlike the Inspiration Blog, Cookmore is a much more complex site using multiple custom built plug-ins and custom Back-end development in order to create the many function of the site.

Cookmore also has the ability to hold contests on the site, collecting information and storing it in a database for use when the contest is over. I personally worked on the 100-Year Anniversary contest. Creating custom pages, elements, and forms all in a dynamic fashion, working with a designer every step of the way and evolving the page when new events or content needed to be added.

Cookmore was the first site that I worked on that was truly a responsive site. The design of the site and the construction of elements was well thought out before development began so that there was no need to fit the design to the device. The design was made for the device you viewed it on.

It was also my first experience working with a team of Front-end and Back-end devs using SVN for version control. I has to learn a lot of new information and I had to pick up on it quickly. The development cycle for any given project could range from as small as a week to a couple months.

While the development on Cookmore has slowed for the moment I look forward to what other projects or features may be added in the future.
