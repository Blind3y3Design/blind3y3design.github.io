Yay! We're up and running using [Jekyll][]. It took some time and has quite a learning curve, but if you're even remotely comfortable with the command line and you want to create a "simple, blog-aware static site" then it could be the thing for you.

I am by no means a command line guru, and before Jekyll I had never used any markdown language. In just two days I got up and running using Jekyll to set this up. The biggest thing that drew me to using Jekyll was that I wanted to set up a workflow using [node](http://nodejs.org/), [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), and [sass](http://sass-lang.com/). Once I installed ruby and set up my grunt stack I realized that it would take more work to version my site before I could push it through FTP to my web host. With Jekyll I could set up a site on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and my version control would be built in to site contruction and deployment.

I have had quite a lot of fun setting everything up and learning more about the command line and how to use these new technologies. 

Big thanks to the creators of [Jekyll][] [@Nick Quaranto](https://github.com/qrush) and [@Tom Preston-Werner](https://github.com/mojombo)
