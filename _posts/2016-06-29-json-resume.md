This project was inspired by the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) project. The idea is that you create a standard JSON-based dataset, and then you can easily reuse that data across a multitide of templates without having to re-write your resume each time you wanted to update the look and feel. Any time you need to update any relevant data you can simply update the JSON and that data is accessible anywhere.

I decided to find a pre-built html resume template that I thought looked interesting and had an array of different data types. I chose to go with [Orbit](http://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/website-templates/orbit-free-resume-cv-template-for-developers/) from #rd Wave Media because it was clean, responsive and had a number of differing data types and ways of displaying that data.

In order to template out Orbit I chose to use [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/installation.html) because I am familiar with how it handles data and I like the felxibility it allows.
