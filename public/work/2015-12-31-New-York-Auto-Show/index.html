<p>The goal with the New York International Auto Show site for 2016 was to present an experience as modern and sleek as the cars that were being presented.</p>
<p>We created a massive vehicle gallery for them, categorizing each vehicle by make and model. The pages were then dynamically generated based on information on the vehicles stores in JSON format. You could sort the vehicles by category, style, and manufacturer.</p>
