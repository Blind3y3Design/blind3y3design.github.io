<p>Yay! We're up and running using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It took some time and has quite a learning curve, but if you're even remotely comfortable with the command line and you want to create a &quot;simple, blog-aware static site&quot; then it could be the thing for you.</p>

<p>I am by no means a command line guru, and before Jekyll I had never used any markdown language. In just two days I got up and running using Jekyll to set this up. The biggest thing that drew me to using Jekyll was that I wanted to set up a workflow using <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node</a>, <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">grunt</a>, and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">sass</a>. Once I installed ruby and set up my grunt stack I realized that it would take more work to version my site before I could push it through FTP to my web host. With Jekyll I could set up a site on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> and my version control would be built in to site contruction and deployment.</p>
<p>I have had quite a lot of fun setting everything up and learning more about the command line and how to use these new technologies.</p>
