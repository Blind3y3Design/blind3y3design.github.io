      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spurred by &lt;a href=&#34;http://notlaura.com/&#34;&gt;Lara Schenck&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s post on &lt;a href=&#34;https://css-tricks.com/tales-of-a-non-unicorn-a-story-about-the-trouble-with-job-titles-and-descriptions/&#34;&gt;CSS-Tricks&lt;/a&gt; I have decided to toss my two cents in to the bountiful fountain of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems the age of &amp;lsquo;Unicorns&amp;rsquo; has spawned a number of people who wind up simply being pricks sitting on their high horses. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that people who claim to be unicorns are those people, or that they&amp;rsquo;re wholly guilt free either. It just seems the issue has bubbled to the surface more apparently in the recent past.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The idea behind designing a single workflow is that at any time someone else should be able to jump in to your workflow and know where in the process you are and pick up after you in needed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scrum and the Agile Philosophy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developing our own Agile process is something that we should take pride in. We can take bits and pieces from frameworks and create something that works for our team. The point is not to go whole hog in to a single framework and force the team to work inside the constraints predefined for a different team.&lt;/p&gt;
