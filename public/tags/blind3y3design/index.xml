      <title>SPA Resume project</title>

      <description>This project was inspired by the JSON resume project. The idea is that you create a standard JSON-based dataset, and then you can easily reuse that data across a multitide of templates without having to re-write your resume each time you wanted to update the look and feel. Any time you need to update any relevant data you can simply update the JSON and that data is accessible anywhere.

      <description>Welcome to the new Blind3y3Design! &amp;ldquo;3.0? What happened to 2.0?&amp;rdquo; you say? Here&amp;rsquo;s the deal; after about 4 months of this site being on vanilla Jekyll I decided to switch over to using Octopress. It was great and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to change much to get it working. The one thing that kept nagging at me was the design. The layout and design of octopress is generally a good layout.</description>

      <title>Vine Lights: Inorganic Life Series</title>
      <link>/2014/01/11/vine-lights/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The work Vine Lights was an experimental piece in a series of works called &amp;ldquo;Inorganic Life.&amp;rdquo; The works themselves try to take things that are clearly inorganic in nature however when constructed in such a way they become in a sense a representation of life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yay! We&amp;rsquo;re up and running using &lt;a href=&#34;http://jekyllrb.com/&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. It took some time and has quite a learning curve, but if you&amp;rsquo;re even remotely comfortable with the command line and you want to create a &amp;ldquo;simple, blog-aware static site&amp;rdquo; then it could be the thing for you.&lt;/p&gt;
