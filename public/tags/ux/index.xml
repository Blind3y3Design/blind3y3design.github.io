      <description>Exploring the UX of Pokemon Go As with everyone else I picked up Pokemon Go when it released in the US this Wednesday. After pouring more than a couple hours in to it, and talking with a lot of people I have a few thoughts on the UX of the app and how it could be improved.

Each one of these products or concepts takes a different approach to the problem, but they are all essentially based on the idea of allowing you to do a task a little bit easier or faster.</description>

      <description>Struggling with UX and Development There was a recent conversation in the UX Community on Slack Designer Hangout about getting developers to follow wireframes from a UX team. I’ve seen this question, and struggles come up hundreds of times in the last couple years.
 My ux team recently has been dealing with front-end developers deciding that they are designers &amp;amp; that ux wireframes are just a loose guideline. It’s been frustrating, because the development ends up having a lot of ux &amp;amp; usability issues.</description>
