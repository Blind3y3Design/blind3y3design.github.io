      <description>&lt;p&gt;##Bridging the ‘Handoff’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://uxreactions.com&#34;&gt;uxreactions.com&lt;/a&gt;
While I appreciate a lot of what is on the site, I must say; seeing the number of developer complaints make me very sad. I also noticed this trend at a recent meetup I attended. A large number of designers; UX, visual, IxD, voiced a number of complaints about developers. I’ve heard the same from developers about designers. I think this is an artifact of traditional waterfall approaches and the ‘hand off’. If we want to grow as teams and communities I think we need to stop complaining about each other and finding ways to bridge the gap. Sometimes an overly decorative design really does affect performance, and a slow experience is a poor experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
