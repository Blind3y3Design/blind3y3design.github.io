      <description>A large portion of the work we do is creating maintaining and updating content on client sites like this one. Personal responsibilities can be anything from updating a JSON file to pull new ads or putting a product feed on a page, to creating completely new and custom pages for a specific product, event, or promotion.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Small Parcel page on Kenco was a unique project when I got to work on it. It was my first experience usning the ExpressionEngine CMS. This page is build by creating a page template and once the templace is set and attached to a page we begin loading content on to it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Most of the work done was largely edits to the CSS files that control the look of the site. We also edited and moved some of the HTML structure in order to better the document flow and user experience.
We recently Added a pop up modal to the homepage which uses an ajax request and API call to send and receive information from another web server. We solved some issues with IE8 by using the XMLHttpRequest function for IE.</description>
