      <description>The Broadway Collection site came with a unique set of problems we had to solve. First and foremost they had to be a neutral party in relation to all of the shows they feature on their site. Secondly, the site is translated into 5 different languages and is updated through a CMS.
In order to solve the first issue we came up with a couple of ideas. The easiest was obviously to list all of the shows in alphabetical order.</description>

      <description>The goal with the New York International Auto Show site for 2016 was to present an experience as modern and sleek as the cars that were being presented.
We created a massive vehicle gallery for them, categorizing each vehicle by make and model. The pages were then dynamically generated based on information on the vehicles stores in JSON format. You could sort the vehicles by category, style, and manufacturer.</description>
