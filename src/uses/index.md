This is the stuff I use to get work done.

## Developer Tools

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my editor of choice since 2016. Briefly explored Atom after years with Sublime Text.
- Recently swapped over to [Monokai Pro](https://monokai.pro/vscode)'s Octoagon theme. Previously used the [Seti-Monokai](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SmukkeKim.theme-setimonokai) theme.
- I switched to [Monaspace Neon](https://monaspace.githubnext.com/) when Github dropped it at Github Next. I'm also tyring out code ligatures for the first time.
- Firefox is my browser of choice. I particularly like it's accessibility tree tools.
- For most terminal needs I use the embedded VS Code terminal. When on MacOS I also use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) with [OhMyZsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

## Other Software

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is the bread and butter of my design tooling. All of my design system work is done within Figma libraries.
- For launchers I use the integrated [PowerToys Run](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/run) utility on windows, and have started using [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) on my Mac.
- [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com) handles all of my music needs.
- [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) for podcasts.

## Hardware

### Custom PC

- [NR200](https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/cases/mini-itx/masterbox-nr200/)
- [Ryzen 7 5800x](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-7-5800x)
- [MSI 3060](https://www.msi.com/Graphics-Card/GeForce-RTX-3060-Ti-VENTUS-2X-8GD6X-OC)
- Logitech G604 (No longer appears to be made?)
- [Keychron K4](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k4-wireless-mechanical-keyboard-version-2) with brown switches and [Hyekit Marshmallow](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XQQDKCG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) Keycaps

### Mac Setup

- 2016 Touchbar Macbook Pro
- iPad Air for the occasional sidecar
- MX Master 2S
- [NuPHy Air 75](https://nuphy.com/collections/keyboards/products/air75-v2?variant=40636609101933) with moss switches and stock caps.

### On My Desk

- [UPLIFT](https://www.upliftdesk.com/) V2 5ft standing desk. I opted for the commercial option. I don't think I'll ever need the weight capacity, but it gives me a place to rest my legs.
- I bought an [Autonomous ErgoChair Pro](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/ergonomic-chair?option_code=ErgonomicChair-ErgoChairPro_ChairColor.BabyBlue) to try and fix my posture. It's decent.
- LG [27"](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27gl850-b-gaming-monitor) and [32"](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-32gk650f-b-gaming-monitor) monitors. Both 1440p, 144hz.
- Still rocking a [Blue Yeti](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/streaming-gear/yeti-premium-usb-microphone.988-000100.html) from 2017. I've heard the quality has gone down since Logitech bought them. Looking to upgare in the near future.
- [Sony a6400](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/aps-c/p/ilce6400-b) with an [18-105](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/lenses/aps-c-e-mount/p/selp18105g) piped through a [CamLink 4k](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/cam-link-4k) for video.
- A [Viltrox VL-200T](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R55RW43/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) bounced off the wall provides lighting.
- A set of [Edifier R1280T](https://www.edifier.com/global/p/bookshelf-speakers/r1280t) speakers for audio playback.

## Travel

- Thanks to my little one my backpack is now the [Ruvalino Diaper Backpack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C3SWZXK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Previously it was the Peak Design [Everyday Messenger](https://www.peakdesign.com/collections/everyday-bags/products/everyday-messenger?variant=29741439189036), and I've had my eye on the [30L Everyday Backpack](https://www.peakdesign.com/collections/everyday-bags/products/everyday-backpack?variant=29743300902956) for a while.
