The Kenmore Ispiration Blog is a community site that collects posts from across the web and combines them with posts by Kenmore and Cookmore. The blog is a community where people can share, post, and learn about all things Kenmore related.

Inspiration is build on a highly customized WordPress installation that is continually being built and improved upon. We recently set up new pages for contests like the “Couponista” challenge. This page followed 3 bloggers in their competition to be the greatest couponer.

We set up custom abilities for the blog so that the posts by the bloggers would not display on any page unless it has the Couponista qualifier set on the page. This allowed for the blog homepage to remain community based while if someone wanted to find information about the Couponista event they could get all of the aggregated posts on a single page.
