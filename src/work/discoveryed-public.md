Discovery Education's dotcom site is the public face of the company and the product.

The team designed a fresh site with a focus on extendable and reusable components. From a development perspective we spent the time to audit and inventory the content needs of the site, then designed and developed a series of content blocks that could be themed and adjusted to quickly produce any page that would appear on the site.
