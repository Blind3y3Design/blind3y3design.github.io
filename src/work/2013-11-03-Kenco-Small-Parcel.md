title: Shipping Something Small

The Small Parcel page on Kenco was a unique project when I got to work on it. It was my first experience usning the ExpressionEngine CMS. This page is build by creating a page template and once the templace is set and attached to a page we begin loading content on to it.

The content can was uploaded one of two ways.

If we were creating a navigation section or a subsection that would be used on multiple pages we would create an ExpressionEngine snippet; a chunk of code that could be called anywhere on a page and could be edited once and dynamically update across all pages it is on.

If it was content specific to one single page we would create an entry in ExpressionEngine known as a block. Blocks are groups of code that can be given a specific category and called to a page much like a snippet; however they tend to be used for single use and not template level design.
