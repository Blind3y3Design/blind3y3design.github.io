Hi there! I am Adam Sedwick. I'm a Clarksville-based designer and developer who's focused on making the web more accessible, and improving products through Design Systems. 

As a Design Systems Lead at Discovery Education I was part of the initial team that build the Comet Design System, and continue to work with the design and development teams to support their needs.

I am also a member of the editorial team for the [Design Tokens Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/design-tokens/). The Design Tokens Community Group's goal is to provide standards upon which products and design tools can rely for sharing stylistic pieces of a design system at scale. 

## Experience

I've been designing and developing on the web professionally for 11 years. I've been focused on advocating for accessibility and working with design systems for 5.
- I am a Design Systems Lead at Discovery Education.
- I was a hybrid Designer and Developer at Situation Interactive. During this time I had the pleasure of working on web proporties for clients such as One World Observatory, and some of Broadwayâ€™s hit shows including School of Rock and Wicked.
- I was a UX and Development lead at BrandWizard, a subsidiary of Interbrand. While at BrandWizard I worked on digital management resources and internal tooling for companies like Qualcomm, AT&T, and American Express.
