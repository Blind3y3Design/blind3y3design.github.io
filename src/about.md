I lead the **Design Systems** team at **Discovery Education**.

Our team focuses on designing and developing the components and systems that are used across all of Discovery Educationâ€™s properties. Our goal is to ensure that every experience is robust, scalable and accessible.

I am also a member of the [Design Tokens Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/design-tokens/), working to establish a standard that tools, designers, and developers can all rely on when creating and using design tokens.
