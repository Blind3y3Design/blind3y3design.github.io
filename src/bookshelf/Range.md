## Book Review:

Originally completed on 8/5/21. Reread for Discovery Education PM Book Club on 7/7/23.

I love this book. Originally picked this up based on the bookshelf recommendation of [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/bookshelf/) and really just vibed with the ideas in the book. It's a refreshing balance against the litany of books promoting hyper-specialization and the infinite optimization of everything we do.

I will continually to recommend this book to anyone who is even slightly interested. It has a multitude of applications, whether you're a young adult who is worried about "making the right decision" for the rest of your life, or you're already well into your career and feel that you've somehow lost out or are "behind" your peers.

On the second read of this book I took away additional thoughts and details; especially after the birth of my son. There was an entirely new level as I began to read again about how we should be teaching our children for success in the future beyond just immediate solutions or satisfaction in the moment.


## Book Notes:

### Chapter 4: Learning, Fast and Slow

#### Page 87

Training with hints does not product any lasting learning

#### Pages 88-89:

**Spacing**

- Leaving time between practice sessions for the same material.
- Bouts of deliberate not practicing between deliberate practice.
- The harder it is, the more you learn
- Space between practice sessions creates the hardness that facilitates learning
- Frustrations is not a sign that you’re not learning, but ease is.

#### Pages 95-96

**Interleaving**

- Interleaving is a process where students mix, or interleave, multiple subjects or topics while they study in order to improve their learning.
- Whether a task is mental or physical , interleaving improves the ability to match the right strategy to the problem.
- The most successful problem solves spend mental energy figuring out what type of problem they are facing before matching a strategy to it, rather than jumping in with memorized procedures

#### General Chapter Notes:

Desirable difficulties like *testing* and *spacing* make knowledge stick. **It becomes durable.**

Desirable difficulties like *making connections* and *interleaving* make knowledge flexible. **Useful for solving problems that never appear in training.**

All slow down learning and make performance suffer in the short term.

“Head Start” programs do just that, give learners a quick head start that ultimately fades and disappears with time as the rest of the learners catch up and learn these same skills with repetition. “While it might be temporarily impressive, there is no evidence that rushing it matters”.

If programs want to impart lasting academic benefits they should focus instead on open skills that scaffold later knowledge. 

- Teaching kids to read a little early is not a lasting advantage.
- Teaching them how to hunt for and connect contextual clues to understand what they read can be.

As with all desirable difficulties, the trouble is that a head start comes fast, but deep learning is slow. The slowest growth “occurs for the most complex skills”

“Seeing a child’s progress” does not indicate a proper judgement of the impact of future learning, research indicates it may not allow proper judgement at all. 

“Before our eyes” progress reinforces the instinct to “do more of the same,” but the feedback can often teach the wrong lesson; learning deeply means learning slowly.

Knowledge with enduring utility must be very flexible; composed of mental schemes that can be matched to new problems.

- Learning to recognize deep structural commonalities in types of problems, and identify underlying conceptual connections, allowing the learner to match a strategy to a type of problem.

**Far Transfer**

- When knowledge is so flexible that it can be mapped to new domains or extremely novel situations.

### Chapter 5: Thinking Outside Experience

#### General Chapter Notes:

Using analogous thinking can help us bridge the gaps between ideas

Not dismissing small incongruities in data sets can explore ideas and help understand the truth in the data

Teams that consist solely of members from similar backgrounds and training can often miss out on solutions due to a lack of diverse thinking

### Chapter 6: The Problem with Too Much Grit

#### Page 136

“Winners quit fast and often when they detect a plan is not the best fit”

- This idea is incredibly valuable. If we can sense that an idea is not working, or we can validate that the idea is not going to provide the goal state, it is important to be ready to drop the idea all together and begin working on something new to reach the goal; rather than wasting additional time trying to push through only to ultimately fail anyway.
- We fail when we “stick with tasks we don’t have the guts to quit”

Persevering through difficulty is a competitive advantage for anyone traveling down a long road; but “knowing when to quit is such a big strategic advantage that every single person, before undertaking an endeavor should enumerate conditions under which they should quit.”

The most important thing is to stay aware of whether switching is a failure of perseverance, or astute recognition that better matches are available.

#### General Chapter Notes:

Understanding that “switching” does not necessarily indicate failure.

- Van Gogh did not become an artist until the last years of his life. He tried and failed at many careers and ventures before landing on being a painter.
- He was continually ridiculed for not knowing how to be an artist, and was even recommended to stop trying and “attend a class for children”
- Ultimately, had Van Gogh died even just 3 years earlier in his life, he would have died in obscurity, it was not until he was 42 that he truly found his calling and became the painter that changed the world.

### Chapter 8: The Outsider Advantage

#### Page 178

Large orgs often fall victim to “local search” only referencing experts in their narrow field for solutions

#### General Chapter Notes:

The more likely a problem is to appeal to a wide range of individuals, the more likely it is to be solved.

“Outside-In Thinking” - Finding solutions and experiences far outside focused training for the problem itself.

### Chapter 9: Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology

#### General Chapter Notes:

The entire Nintendo Story

- Don’t just play with technology, play with ideas
- “Do not be an engineer, Be a producer”
    - The Producer knows that there’s such a thing as a semiconductor, but doesn’t need to know it’s inner workings; that can be left to the experts.
- Consistently push to consider alternate uses for old technology.
    - Allow for ideas to be explored and flourish rather than simply throwing them away due to potential technical limitations.
- In order to set the tone, it may be worth shouting out intentionally crazy ideas in order to get people to understand that anything is allowed and no one should be afraid of “looking stupid or foolish” for their ideas.
- The road to new users may not always be the most obvious one.
    - The Wii’s wild success hinged on introducing an entirely new audience to gaming; One that was older and did not understand the complex controls accounted with more traditional gaming.

### Chapter 11: Learning to Drop Your Familiar Tools

#### General Chapter Notes:

Carter Racing business exercise - challenger explosion

- Remember to ask for more information if you feel it would be valuable
- “Is this the data we want, to make the decisions we need to make?”
- Drop you’re familiar tools
    - When met with new or unique challenges, don’t be afraid to drop the tools and methods that you’re familiar with in order to get the ideal outcome
- When knowledge and practice become so institutionalized that everyone agrees that they’re the core of how everything is done it can be hard to step away from those ideas, but it is important to remember that nothing is to sacrosanct to question or consider changing when the options are tough
- Difference in chain of command and chain of communication.
- The chain of communication should be way more informal and casual, often with a healthy drive for debate and competition between ideas, regardless of where in the chain of command an idea comes from

### Chapter 12: Deliberate Amateurs

#### General Chapter Notes:

- Think Laterally. Broaden your experiences and forge your own path in search of match quality.
    - Take your skills to a place that’s not doing the same sort of thing.
    - Take your skills and apply them to a new problem.
    - Take your problem, and try completely new skills.
- The word Amateur was not originally created as an insult.
    - Derived from the Latin word "Amator" for a person who adores a particular endeavor
- “Do not dig deep, Graze shallow”
    - It can be helpful to consistently look into new fields and learn new things.
    - Deviation can bring advantages for motivation and for “Questioning things people who work in that area never bothered to ask”
- “The Principle of Limited Sloppiness”
    - Be careful not to be too careful, or you will unconsciously limit your options
- Broad conceptual skill application, deep experience and hyper specialization all need to be available and used in order to get the best results
- The R3 Initiative
    - Rigor. Responsibility and Reproducibility
    - “You have people walking around with all the knowledge of the world on their phone, but with no idea how to integrate it.”
    - “We don’t train people in thinking or reasoning,” often doctors and scientists are not even trained in the underlying thinking of their tools or procedures.
    - Higher level and hyper specialized training can often cause individuals to remove their broader reasoning skills to solve a problem, even when the solutions are not difficult for the skills of the individual, because they are not prized for doing so.
- “Compare yourself to yourself yesterday. Not to younger people who aren’t you.”
    - Everyone progresses at a different rate, so don’t let anyone else make you feel behind
    - You probably don’t even know where you’re going so feeling behind doesn’t help
    - Start planning experiments, approach your own personal voyage and projects willing to learn and adjust as you go.
    - Be willing to adapt or abandon ideas complete should the need arise.
- There is nothing inherently wrong with specialization, but it is not the only route.
- Mental meandering and personal experimentation are sources of power, and head starts are overrated.
