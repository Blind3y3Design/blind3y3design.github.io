One World Observatory is located on the top levels of the One World Trade building. Our goal with this project was to give a sense of presence to the site.

Some of the biggest challenges that we encountered when working on this site came from the fact that observatory is a government entity, and because of this we had to meet additional security and usability benchmarks.

I had the pleasure of working on the usability and accessibility of the site. At the bare minumum we had to ensure Section 508 compliance. Some of the resources we used for this were: Khan Academy's [tota11y](http://khan.github.io/tota11y/) and [the a11y project](http://a11yproject.com/), along with the official [Section 508 website](https://www.section508.gov/).
