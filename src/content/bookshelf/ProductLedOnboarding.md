## Chapter 1: User Onboarding - Your Product’s First Impression

### **Onboarding should be defined by how much a user’s life has improved, not by how many features they have learned, or how much they need a tool.**

Super Mario Bros Example:
You’re not excited about a fire flower because it has a green stem and is easy to pick up; you get excited because once you pick it up you become a _fireball shooting super mario_ In this same way; user onboarding should not be focused on the features or characteristics of a fire flower (green stem, easy to pick up) even though they are important.

_How are you helping user’s lives with your product?_

**_Related Idea and Concepts:_**

Nintendo does an amazing job of onboarding players to their games; specifically with Mario and Zelda.

There is a known pattern to how to introduce a new feature or mechanic to a Mario game:

1. First the player is introduced to the feature or mechanic in a “no fail” state; either a single block with no enemies in 1-1, or a wiggler trapped in a hole in a stage so the player can view how it works
2. Next the player is asked to demonstrate an understanding of the new mechanic through a few “low risk” challenges. a typical example of this could involve some light platforming, while there is ground beneath the player so if they miss a platform they don’t die
3. Finally the player is presented with the true challenge. Based on the previous example; this would be a platforming section with holes or no ground, so missing a platform would result in the loss of a life.
4. Ultimately this pattern is used across multiple levels and can even be used to combine multiple features or elements into new complex challenges.

This type of onboarding and _progressive disclosure_ is incredibly powerful in making sure the user is confident and knows what to expect before giving them new or harder challenges to overcome; or in the case of onboarding, additional or advances features.

### **Habit-led user onboarding:**

- Worth noting that not all users can form habits
- Recently a viral trending topic on TikTok, ND users are physiologically unable to form the mental connections for habits
- Relying only on this form of understanding or behavior pattern can result in an incredibly frustrating experience for some users
