import PostLink from "@components/PostLink.astro";

I doubt he was specifically talking about this blog; but after reading Chris' post I checked and realized that I am one of those sites taht does not auto-expose their RSS feed in the HTML. I've since added the relevant line in my `head` and we should be good to go.

What a week, first I learn how to easily set up import aliases, and now I've got a properly exposed RSS feed. Wondering what I'll learn I'm missing next week.
