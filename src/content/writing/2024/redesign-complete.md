Shorter post today.

After a few months of delays and reworks I finally decided on an overall theme for the site, put together the design, and got it out the door.

I’ll write up a longer overview and breakdown later on, but I’m super happy with the final result and even more so that it’s finally out the door and I could remove the construction banner at the top of the site.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I do, and I look forward to writing about it some more.
