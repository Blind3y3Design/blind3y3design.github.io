One thing I've struggled with on many iterations of this blog is the constant `../../path/to/file` string for references, whether imports, css, or images. I've never really understood how to set up import aliases and always just dealt with the tedious task of updating or changing those strings if I ever moved a file.

Good news! [Coding in Public](https://www.youtube.com/@CodinginPublic) released a new video today that explained exactly how to set them up (and in Astro no less)!

Go check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0P7Kn3GFMQ).
