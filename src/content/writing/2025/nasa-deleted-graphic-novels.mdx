In 2021 and 2023 NASA issues two interactive graphic novels under the title “First Woman.” According to their press releases they were about "...the story of Callie Rodriguez, the first woman to explore the Moon," and "...a diverse crew of astronauts on the Moon's surface who learn and grow as a team, navigate the unexpected, and conduct experiments and technology demonstrations for the benefit of humanity."

Because our government has seen fit to cleanse the internet of any mention of the accomplishments of women, poc, and queer folk, these books were pulled from their internet platforms. Thankfully they've been saved and archived by the wonderful people of the internet and are available through Wikimedia.

You can download them here:
[Volume 1: Dream to Reality](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/The_first_woman_on_moon_novel.pdf),
[Volume 2: Expanding our Universe](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/First_Woman_issue_2_Expanding_Our_Universe.pdf)

In the face of authoritarian overreach, we have to actively resist. The people of the internet never forget. Keep preserving knowledge and sharing stories.
