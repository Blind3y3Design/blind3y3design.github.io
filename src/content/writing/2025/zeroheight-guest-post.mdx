Design systems don't scale by locking things down—they scale by opening them up.

I wrote a piece for Zeroheight on why composability wins over inheritance when it comes to building systems that actually work for teams.
Instead of bloated libraries and endless one-offs, composability lets you:

- Mix and match flexible parts
- Move faster without breaking the system
- Contribute back patterns that make the whole thing stronger
