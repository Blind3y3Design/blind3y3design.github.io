It seems I wasn't the only one who went to visit Andy Bell's post [A Modern CSS Reset](https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-modern-css-reset/) after it made an appearance on the Shoptalk podcast.

He's since put out an updated post, so I figured since I commented on the first it was worth sharing the new one.
