Brad Frost recently posted [this wonderful article](https://bradfrost.com/blog/link/from-template-to-atoms/) reminding us all that Atomic Design is not a step-by-step process, and instead a mental model we should use to look at the parts and whole of a design at the same time.

I know that I’ve been guilty of this myself. It’s very easy to fall into the trap of designing in a vacuum; especially with “Atomic” components like buttons or input elements. The idea that you can just design something real quick and push it out to users in an incredibly enticing one, but designing anything without understanding the context in which it will live and the content that will ultimately surround it is a recipe for disaster.

So thanks for the reminder Brad!
