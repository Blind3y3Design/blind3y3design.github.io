This past weekend Dave Rupert put out a [blog post](https://daverupert.com/2023/10/accessiblity-shamed/) talking about being publicly shamed for having poor accessibility. In his closing thoughts he talks about how; despite his growing knowledge and experience designing accessible products, he stills finds “creating end-to-end accessible experiences difficult.” I particularly resonated with the penultimate sentence of the post.

> *After nearly thirty years of making websites –despite being someone who cares deeply– I’m more confident in my ability to produce an inaccessible experience than an accessible one.*

I call myself an Accessibility Advocate, a term I am very comfortable with. I will always go to bat for accessibility, fighting hand-over-fist for individuals who so often are forgotten, ignored, or treated like an afterthought stapled on at the end. I believe that “Accessible Design” is “Good Design,” creating a more usable experience improves that experience for everyone. I have first-hand experience with cognitive disabilities, and have experienced temporary and situational physical disabilities.

Despite all of that, I do not call myself an expert. I do not believe any one person could be an “Accessibility Expert.” There is simply too much to know. I can not tell you how someone who is bind personally experiences the web, what tools they use, or how they navigate a page. I don’t have experience with getting vertigo because something moved too fast across a screen, or getting derailed from an experience because of a distracting audio source.

I know all of these things happen, and that all of these people are just as deserving of a great experience as the rest of us, but even I make mistakes. All I can do is try my best, and call for others to do the same. The world of accessibility is a vast one. It can often feel like an overwhelming amount of information to try and retain, but start small. Something is better than nothing.
