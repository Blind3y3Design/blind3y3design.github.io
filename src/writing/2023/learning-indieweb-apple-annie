I’ve been wanting to learn more about indieweb tech and how to incorporate more if it into my site.

This past week [Anne](https://omg.anniegreens.lol/) over at Apple Annie’s shared a [post collecting her recent writing](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/2023/12/diving-into-indiewebify-me-microformats-a-series) about her own indieweb adventures using [indiewebify.me](https://indiewebify.me)

I plan on reading and learning from these over the next few weeks and thought a signal boost was in order.

Thanks for putting this all together Annie!
