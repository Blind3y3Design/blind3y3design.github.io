This past week I decided to redesign my website from the ground up. I migrated from Hugo to 11ty, added posts that had before only existed on medium, and reworked the IA and content to better fit who I am and what I feel constitutes a "good" website. During this process I realized just how much I have neglected my personal site over the last three years. I mean, the copyright on the previous version was still dated 2018.

This process along with all of the changes to our lives over the last year, like a year-long global pandemic, has caused me to take a step back and inventory what I want out of my life and career. So, for the first time ever, I am going to publically establish some goals for myself.

My Wife and I were _supposed_ to have our wedding last year. While we did end up getting married we did not get the chance to have our wedding. We are very excited to get to celebrate our marriage this year with a "wedding party." On the 1 year anniversary of our marriage date we will finally get to have our "big day" this March.

The most challenging goal for myself that I want to set this year is to write more. I constantly feel like I have knowledge to share, and as a result I create drafts and notes on ideas for writing, but then I ultimately don't make the time to write and those ideas are lost to the void.

I'm sure the notorious "imposter syndrome" plays a part in this, but I want to push myself to at least put _something_ out in to the world. Speaking with others in the industry who have spoken at conferences, and help lead massive initiatives it's clear that the best thing we can do is to share our knowledge. Writing is the first, and easiest, step to getting your name out and becoming a recognized member of the community.

Photography has always been a passion of mine, and this last year I bought a new camera promising myself that I would make it a "worth while" purchase by using it. While the pandemic may have put a damper on any larger trips, we were able to take a few smaller trips to local hiking and nature trails, and bring the camera along allowed for me to capture some amazing memories with my wife and our dog. I would like to continue to explore this additonal creative outlet and find beauty and inspiration through my lense.

Finally I am going to set a health goal. Our careers choice unfortunately dictates that we spend a fair bit of time in front of a computer screen, typically sitting in a chair. This, coupled with quarantines and stay-at-home orders has begun to take it's toll on my mental and physical health. With the help of my loving wife I have begun a workout regiment and can already tell that when I am active I feel better. Between my wife's love for hiking and all of the amazing views that people like Marcy Sutton share on social media I am going to set a goal for myself this year to go on at least one larger hike.
