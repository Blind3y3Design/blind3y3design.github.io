I design programs to test the usability and clarity of designs. I also audit for accessibility, beyond simple compliance.

A primary focus in my work is User-Centered, Accessible, and Inclsive design and development practices.

I have developed the skills to take a project from stategic conception to production-ready code. Projects start with the basic business requirements gathering that is then balanced against user needs. From there we can begin sketching and prototyping initial designs until we come up with a final layout. Ideally we would apply a the principles and components developed in a design system to this layout.

Once we have a static layout decided upon the next step is to take those designs and begin setting up interaction prototypes. Taking this extra step provides a clearer idea to the Development and QA teams as to what the final product should look and behave like.

The page is then built using the existing codebase's development procedures and standards.
