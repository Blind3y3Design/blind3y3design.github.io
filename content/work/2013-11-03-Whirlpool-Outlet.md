Most of the work done was largely edits to the CSS files that control the look of the site. We also edited and moved some of the HTML structure in order to better the document flow and user experience.

We recently Added a pop up modal to the homepage which uses an ajax request and API call to send and receive information from another web server. We solved some issues with IE8 by using the XMLHttpRequest function for IE.
